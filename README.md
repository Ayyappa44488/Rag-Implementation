To enhance the accuracy of data retrieval in this Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation, I've implemented a three-pronged approach:
Hierarchical Data Organization: Data is structured hierarchically to facilitate more precise retrieval. This means structuring data in a tree-like manner, allowing for efficient navigation and selection of relevant information.
Metadata Enrichment: Each data point is enriched with relevant metadata, allowing for more targeted and accurate retrieval based on specific criteria. This means adding tags, categories, or other descriptive information to your data.
Self-Querying Retriever: A self-querying retrieval mechanism is employed, enabling the system to refine its own queries iteratively for improved results. This implies that the system can learn from its initial retrieval attempts and adjust its search strategy for better accuracy.
This multi-faceted approach ensures that the RAG system can efficiently and accurately locate the most relevant information within the dataset.
